# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-27)

**Core value:** The two agents play a complete, rule-compliant, cryptographically-verifiable game that both sides report correctly.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — base-logic

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (base-logic) — COMPLETE (all 5 plans executed)
Plan: 5 of 5 (all complete)
Status: Awaiting verify-work
Last activity: 2026-07-28

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: RL (tabular Q-learning) with a Bayes+Manhattan fallback as the strategy
- Init: Fixed 8-phase build order (book §10.3 stages 1–7 + submission phase 8) — phases are not re-derived
- Init: Real `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/TODO.md` (Segal §2.2), not `.planning/` pointers
- Init: GSD config — Balanced models, Interactive mode, branching none, TDD on, UI phases off
- [Phase ?]: D-05: all game numerics in game_params.json — zero hardcoded values in any src/ file (Appendix F §2 rule 1)
- [Phase ?]: D-06: game_params.json duplicated byte-for-byte in config/police/ and config/thief/ for Phase-2 NET-09 identity check
- [Phase ?]: D-04: package name is pursuit — neutral, usable by both cop and thief repos at Phase 8 split
- [Phase 01-01]: D-07: constants.py/Enum hold only structural non-numeric values; zero game numbers hardcoded
- [Phase 01-01]: D-08: barriered cell is impassable; get_legal_moves excludes it (prerequisite for BASE-05)
- [Phase 01-01]: D-12: GameState @dataclass(frozen=True); immutable snapshot pattern; dataclasses.replace for transitions
- [Phase 01-01]: D-13: STAY (current position) always in legal moves; agent can always pass even surrounded by barriers
- [Phase 01-01]: D-14: Outcome enum names all four outcomes; only CAPTURE/SURVIVAL produced in Phase 1
- [Phase 01-02]: D-10: barrier-on-thief IS accepted; capture consequence owned by detect_capture (01-03)
- [Phase 01-02]: D-11: quota enforced via params.barrier_quota only; zero numeric literals in barrier.py (AST verified)
- [Phase 01-02]: Validate-first order in place_barrier prevents Pitfall 2 (spurious quota consumption on invalid placements)
- [Phase 01-03]: D-12 check order: BASE-03 (cop==thief) -> BASE-04 (thief in barriers) -> BASE-05 (no legal moves) -> None
- [Phase 01-03]: D-13 note: BASE-05 independent trigger geometrically impossible; STAY always legal unless BASE-04 fires first
- [Phase 01-03]: D-14: score_outcome reads exclusively from params.score_* fields; only literal 0 for TECHNICAL_LOSS
- [Phase 01-03]: D-15: Phase 1 produces only CAPTURE/SURVIVAL; TIE/TECHNICAL_LOSS unreachable but scored for completeness
- [Phase 01-03]: D-16: evaluate_turn_end uses params.survival_threshold (no hardcoded value)
- [Phase Phase 01-04]: D-09: engine.apply_cop_action wires cop move + barrier placement in one cop action
- [Phase Phase 01-04]: D-12: engine wires the turn boundary: apply_cop_action does cop-acts + capture-check, apply_thief_move does thief-move + turn-increment + survival-check
- [Phase Phase 01-04]: increment_turn() added to state.py so engine.py has zero non-zero numeric literals (AST scan clean)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Team code (SUB-06) and per-game config naming are league prerequisites — decide before first scored game
- Reporting (REPORT-01) is submission-critical: a missing/contradictory report zeroes both teams
