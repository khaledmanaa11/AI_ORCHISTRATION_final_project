# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-27)

**Core value:** The two agents play a complete, rule-compliant, cryptographically-verifiable game that both sides report correctly.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — fastmcp-infrastructure (Phase 01 complete; Wave 0 of Phase 02 executed)

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (fastmcp-infrastructure) — EXECUTING (Wave 1 / plan 02-04 done)
Plan: 5 of 11 executed (02-00, 02-01, 02-02, 02-03, 02-04 done; 02-05 … 02-10 remain across Waves 1-5)
Status: Phase 1 of 8 done — 7 phases remaining. Next: continue Phase 02 with plan 02-05
  (docs/PRD_mcp_transport.md) or run /gsd:execute-phase 2 again to pick up where this
  session stopped.
Last activity: 2026-07-28 -- Executed 02-04-PLAN.md: added src/pursuit/network/event_log.py
  (EventType six members incl. ILLEGAL_TRANSITION/WATCHDOG_INCIDENT; EventField; build_event()
  omits absent optionals; append_event() validate->serialize->write->flush->os.fsync->echo,
  in that literal order, D-11; console_line() pure) and src/pursuit/network/watchdog.py
  (Watchdog daemon thread — touch/start/stop/check_once; check_once() strict-> threshold
  compare, on_freeze then injected exit_action in that order per RESEARCH Pitfall 6, a
  raising on_freeze suppressed via contextlib.suppress so exit still fires; WatchdogExit
  IntEnum; threshold_seconds/poll_seconds required keyword-only, no default in source, D-18).
  tests/unit/test_watchdog.py split into two files at the 150-line limit (plan-anticipated);
  a flaky real-thread lifecycle test fixed with a threading.Event sync barrier instead of a
  timed sleep. uv run pytest tests/unit/ -x -q: 108 passed, 25 skipped, 0 regressions.
  Coverage: event_log.py 100%, watchdog.py 98% (only the real os._exit() call untested by
  design). Plan-internal "watchdog" substring tension (required EventType.WATCHDOG_INCIDENT
  enum value vs. the plan's own substring-scan verify checks) documented in the SUMMARY,
  same resolution pattern as 02-03's event_log tension.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: RL (tabular Q-learning) with a Bayes+Manhattan fallback as the strategy
- Init: Fixed 8-phase build order (book §10.3 stages 1–7 + submission phase 8) — phases are not re-derived
- Init: Real `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/TODO.md` (Segal §2.2), not `.planning/` pointers
- Init: GSD config — Balanced models, Interactive mode, branching none, TDD on, UI phases off
- [Phase ?]: D-05: all game numerics in game_params.json — zero hardcoded values in any src/ file (Appendix F §2 rule 1)
- [Phase ?]: D-06: game_params.json duplicated byte-for-byte in config/police/ and config/thief/ for Phase-2 NET-09 identity check
- [Phase ?]: D-04: package name is pursuit — neutral, usable by both cop and thief repos at Phase 8 split
- [Phase 01-01]: D-07: constants.py/Enum hold only structural non-numeric values; zero game numbers hardcoded
- [Phase 01-01]: D-08: barriered cell is impassable; get_legal_moves excludes it (prerequisite for BASE-05)
- [Phase 01-01]: D-12: GameState @dataclass(frozen=True); immutable snapshot pattern; dataclasses.replace for transitions
- [Phase 01-01]: D-13: STAY (current position) always in legal moves; agent can always pass even surrounded by barriers
- [Phase 01-01]: D-14: Outcome enum names all four outcomes; only CAPTURE/SURVIVAL produced in Phase 1
- [Phase 01-02]: D-10: barrier-on-thief IS accepted; capture consequence owned by detect_capture (01-03)
- [Phase 01-02]: D-11: quota enforced via params.barrier_quota only; zero numeric literals in barrier.py (AST verified)
- [Phase 01-02]: Validate-first order in place_barrier prevents Pitfall 2 (spurious quota consumption on invalid placements)
- [Phase 01-03]: D-12 check order: BASE-03 (cop==thief) -> BASE-04 (thief in barriers) -> BASE-05 (no legal moves) -> None
- [Phase 01-03]: D-13 note: BASE-05 independent trigger geometrically impossible; STAY always legal unless BASE-04 fires first
- [Phase 01-03]: D-14: score_outcome reads exclusively from params.score_* fields; only literal 0 for TECHNICAL_LOSS
- [Phase 01-03]: D-15: Phase 1 produces only CAPTURE/SURVIVAL; TIE/TECHNICAL_LOSS unreachable but scored for completeness
- [Phase 01-03]: D-16: evaluate_turn_end uses params.survival_threshold (no hardcoded value)
- [Phase Phase 01-04]: D-09: engine.apply_cop_action wires cop move + barrier placement in one cop action
- [Phase Phase 01-04]: D-12: engine wires the turn boundary: apply_cop_action does cop-acts + capture-check, apply_thief_move does thief-move + turn-increment + survival-check
- [Phase Phase 01-04]: increment_turn() added to state.py so engine.py has zero non-zero numeric literals (AST scan clean)
- [Phase 02-00]: D-04/D-16/D-17/D-18: config/{police,thief}/network.json holds every network number; ports 8001/8002 and watchdog_poll_seconds=1 are engineering defaults not traced to PARAMETERS.md; retry_count=3/backoff_seconds=5 reused from Table 19 Gatekeeper rows
- [Phase 02-01]: QUAL-02: require_key/require_int/require_str extracted to src/pursuit/shared/loader_helpers.py at the second consumer (network_config.py); config.py re-pointed at it, zero private validator copies remain
- [Phase 02-01]: NET-02 guaranteed by construction: load_network_config returns a fresh NetworkParams every call, no module-level cache/singleton; verified by identity checks in both directions (police vs thief, and two calls to the same file)
- [Phase 02-01]: Reused 02-00's NetworkConfigKey.ENV_HOST/ENV_PORT/ENV_OPPONENT_URL for the D-16 override names instead of adding a duplicate NetworkEnvVar class
- [Phase 02-02]: D-06: Envelope frozen dataclass fixed at exactly four keys {type, turn, sender, payload}; from_dict accepts wire `type` as a string only, never a MessageType instance; Phase-4 hint / Phase-6 commit arrive as new MessageType members, never new envelope keys
- [Phase 02-02]: D-08/D-15: config_digest hashes canonically re-serialized JSON (sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":")), never raw file bytes, so formatting drift can never fake a NET-09 config mismatch; canonical_json() is the single project-wide canonicalisation Phase 6's commit-reveal hash must reuse (QUAL-02)
- [Phase 02-02]: digests_match uses secrets.compare_digest per CLAUDE.md's standing digest-comparison idiom, ahead of Phase 6 where it becomes security-critical
- [Phase 02-03]: D-09/D-12: State enum fixed at exactly six members; ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS is an explicit dict[State, frozenset[State]] keyed by every member, GAME_OVER/ERROR terminal (empty frozenset) — no FSM library imported or installed
- [Phase 02-03]: D-10: RECOVERABLE_ATTEMPTS is exactly six pairs (four self-transition duplicates + two late-handshake pairs); every other illegal pair — including anything out of ERROR and any backwards jump to INIT — is PROTOCOL_VIOLATION and escalates to State.ERROR
- [Phase 02-03]: NET-05: transition() calls the injected reporter from a single call site before the outcome branch, guaranteeing every illegal attempt is reported exactly once and a legal transition reports zero times
- [Phase 02-03]: reporter is injected as a TransitionReporter Protocol parameter, not imported — state_machine.py has zero dependency on 02-04's event log, keeping 02-03/02-04 same-wave-safe; 02-04's adapter must match the exact keyword-only __call__(*, current, target, severity, reason) -> None shape
- [Phase 02-03]: NET-02: TurnStateMachine keeps state on the instance only (self._state); no module-level mutable current-state variable anywhere in state_machine.py
- [Phase 02-04]: D-11/NET-05/NET-07: append_event() enforces validate->serialize->write->flush->os.fsync->echo, in that literal order — a rejected record never creates/grows the log, durability always precedes the console echo
- [Phase 02-04]: D-14/D-18/NET-07 (RESEARCH Pitfall 6): Watchdog.check_once() runs on_freeze (suppressing exceptions) THEN the injected exit_action, verified by reading the incident file from inside the exit callable itself; threshold_seconds/poll_seconds are required keyword-only constructor args with no default in source
- [Phase 02-04]: watchdog_poll_seconds was already present in NetworkParams/network.json (=1, D-18) before this plan ran — no hand-off gap to close at 02-09
- [Phase 02-04]: Plan-internal tension (same category as 02-03's event_log substring issue): EventType.WATCHDOG_INCIDENT = "watchdog_incident" is required verbatim by the interfaces contract, but the plan's own verify/decoupling-audit scripts substring-scan for "watchdog" in event_log.py and flag it. Resolved by rewording every avoidable docstring mention (in both event_log.py and watchdog.py) and documenting the one irreducible, schema-required occurrence in the SUMMARY; true import-level decoupling (no `import` of watchdog in event_log.py or vice versa) independently re-verified and holds

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~Team code (SUB-06)~~ **Decided: `khm-mn17`** (08-CONTEXT.md); per-game config naming still a league prerequisite
- Reporting (REPORT-01) is submission-critical: a missing/contradictory report zeroes both teams
- League opponents must be contacted early (this week) — scored games realistically Aug 11–12 post-exam

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-07-28T20:16:00Z
Stopped at: Completed 02-04-PLAN.md (JSONL event log event_log.py — D-11/NET-05/NET-07;
  watchdog daemon thread watchdog.py — D-14/D-18/NET-07, incident-before-exit ordering
  per RESEARCH Pitfall 6). SUMMARY at
  .planning/phases/02-fastmcp-infrastructure/02-04-SUMMARY.md.
  Carried forward: Phase-01 code review CR-01 still deferred; Phase-2 triplet
  (docs/phases/phase-2/{PRD,PLAN,TODO}.md) still needs its TODO rows for 02-05..02-10
  ticked as those plans land, and the full sweep at /gsd:verify-work time.
Resume file: None — continue with plan 02-05 (docs/PRD_mcp_transport.md) via
  /gsd:execute-phase 2 (clear context first).
  Per-day sequence from Phase 3 on: /gsd:graphify → [/gsd:ai-integration-phase N for 3 & 4]
  → /gsd:plan-phase N --chunked → /gsd:execute-phase N → /gsd:verify-work N
