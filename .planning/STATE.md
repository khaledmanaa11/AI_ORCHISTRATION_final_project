# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-27)

**Core value:** The two agents play a complete, rule-compliant, cryptographically-verifiable game that both sides report correctly.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — fastmcp-infrastructure (Phase 01 complete; Wave 0 of Phase 02 executed)

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (fastmcp-infrastructure) — EXECUTED (Wave 5 / plan 02-10 done — all 11 code plans complete)
Plan: 11 of 11 executed (02-00 .. 02-10 all done). No plan remains for Phase 02; next step
  is /gsd:verify-work 2 to close the phase (tick docs/phases/phase-2/TODO.md row 2-99,
  root docs/TODO.md, confirm the .planning/graphs/ refresh).
Status: Phase 1 of 8 done, Phase 2's code plans all executed — 6 phases remaining after
  verify-work closes Phase 2. Next: run /gsd:verify-work 2, then /gsd:discuss-phase 3.
Last activity: 2026-07-29 -- Executed 02-10-PLAN.md (§10.4 phase-gate integration tests +
  NET-01..09 coverage audit + real two-process launch). Task 1: tests/integration/conftest.py
  (shared fixtures) + test_peer_roundtrip.py (GATE-1, coordinate-faithful move envelope
  through the real tool surface). Task 2: test_turn_isolation.py (GATE-2, NET-02 asserted
  positively) + test_turn_lifecycle.py (GATE-3 core, full lifecycle + illegal-transition
  severity) + test_turn_resilience.py (GATE-3 resilience, technical win + watchdog
  ordering) -- three modules, not two, after a second 150-line-gate split. While writing
  the full-lifecycle test, found and fixed two real bugs in turn_actions.py: (1)
  await_opponent_turn called Envelope.from_dict on an already-decoded Envelope (tools.py's
  real _accept enqueues an Envelope instance, never a dict); (2) take_my_turn
  unconditionally re-attempted the MY_TURN transition every call, colliding with the state
  await_opponent_turn's own prior call legitimately leaves it in every cycle after the
  first -- silently capping every real game at ONE exchange before a false technical win
  (rules 16/22). Both confirmed via standalone probe scripts before fixing; one existing
  unit test corrected to match the fix, one regression test added. Task 3: coverage audit
  closed (8/8 gate nodes pass, NET-01..09 each mapped). Task 4: a REAL two-process
  standalone launch (uv run python -m pursuit.main --config-dir config/police|thief) ran a
  full 35-turn game over real localhost HTTP to a clean SURVIVAL outcome -- two distinct
  PIDs, ports, config roots, and JSONL logs; no leaked opponent position. Full suite 179
  passed, 0 skipped, 0 regressions; coverage 96.87% (>=85%); ruff/line-limit clean
  repo-wide.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: RL (tabular Q-learning) with a Bayes+Manhattan fallback as the strategy
- Init: Fixed 8-phase build order (book §10.3 stages 1–7 + submission phase 8) — phases are not re-derived
- Init: Real `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/TODO.md` (Segal §2.2), not `.planning/` pointers
- Init: GSD config — Balanced models, Interactive mode, branching none, TDD on, UI phases off
- [Phase ?]: D-05: all game numerics in game_params.json — zero hardcoded values in any src/ file (Appendix F §2 rule 1)
- [Phase ?]: D-06: game_params.json duplicated byte-for-byte in config/police/ and config/thief/ for Phase-2 NET-09 identity check
- [Phase ?]: D-04: package name is pursuit — neutral, usable by both cop and thief repos at Phase 8 split
- [Phase 01-01]: D-07: constants.py/Enum hold only structural non-numeric values; zero game numbers hardcoded
- [Phase 01-01]: D-08: barriered cell is impassable; get_legal_moves excludes it (prerequisite for BASE-05)
- [Phase 01-01]: D-12: GameState @dataclass(frozen=True); immutable snapshot pattern; dataclasses.replace for transitions
- [Phase 01-01]: D-13: STAY (current position) always in legal moves; agent can always pass even surrounded by barriers
- [Phase 01-01]: D-14: Outcome enum names all four outcomes; only CAPTURE/SURVIVAL produced in Phase 1
- [Phase 01-02]: D-10: barrier-on-thief IS accepted; capture consequence owned by detect_capture (01-03)
- [Phase 01-02]: D-11: quota enforced via params.barrier_quota only; zero numeric literals in barrier.py (AST verified)
- [Phase 01-02]: Validate-first order in place_barrier prevents Pitfall 2 (spurious quota consumption on invalid placements)
- [Phase 01-03]: D-12 check order: BASE-03 (cop==thief) -> BASE-04 (thief in barriers) -> BASE-05 (no legal moves) -> None
- [Phase 01-03]: D-13 note: BASE-05 independent trigger geometrically impossible; STAY always legal unless BASE-04 fires first
- [Phase 01-03]: D-14: score_outcome reads exclusively from params.score_* fields; only literal 0 for TECHNICAL_LOSS
- [Phase 01-03]: D-15: Phase 1 produces only CAPTURE/SURVIVAL; TIE/TECHNICAL_LOSS unreachable but scored for completeness
- [Phase 01-03]: D-16: evaluate_turn_end uses params.survival_threshold (no hardcoded value)
- [Phase Phase 01-04]: D-09: engine.apply_cop_action wires cop move + barrier placement in one cop action
- [Phase Phase 01-04]: D-12: engine wires the turn boundary: apply_cop_action does cop-acts + capture-check, apply_thief_move does thief-move + turn-increment + survival-check
- [Phase Phase 01-04]: increment_turn() added to state.py so engine.py has zero non-zero numeric literals (AST scan clean)
- [Phase 02-00]: D-04/D-16/D-17/D-18: config/{police,thief}/network.json holds every network number; ports 8001/8002 and watchdog_poll_seconds=1 are engineering defaults not traced to PARAMETERS.md; retry_count=3/backoff_seconds=5 reused from Table 19 Gatekeeper rows
- [Phase 02-01]: QUAL-02: require_key/require_int/require_str extracted to src/pursuit/shared/loader_helpers.py at the second consumer (network_config.py); config.py re-pointed at it, zero private validator copies remain
- [Phase 02-01]: NET-02 guaranteed by construction: load_network_config returns a fresh NetworkParams every call, no module-level cache/singleton; verified by identity checks in both directions (police vs thief, and two calls to the same file)
- [Phase 02-01]: Reused 02-00's NetworkConfigKey.ENV_HOST/ENV_PORT/ENV_OPPONENT_URL for the D-16 override names instead of adding a duplicate NetworkEnvVar class
- [Phase 02-02]: D-06: Envelope frozen dataclass fixed at exactly four keys {type, turn, sender, payload}; from_dict accepts wire `type` as a string only, never a MessageType instance; Phase-4 hint / Phase-6 commit arrive as new MessageType members, never new envelope keys
- [Phase 02-02]: D-08/D-15: config_digest hashes canonically re-serialized JSON (sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":")), never raw file bytes, so formatting drift can never fake a NET-09 config mismatch; canonical_json() is the single project-wide canonicalisation Phase 6's commit-reveal hash must reuse (QUAL-02)
- [Phase 02-02]: digests_match uses secrets.compare_digest per CLAUDE.md's standing digest-comparison idiom, ahead of Phase 6 where it becomes security-critical
- [Phase 02-03]: D-09/D-12: State enum fixed at exactly six members; ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS is an explicit dict[State, frozenset[State]] keyed by every member, GAME_OVER/ERROR terminal (empty frozenset) — no FSM library imported or installed
- [Phase 02-03]: D-10: RECOVERABLE_ATTEMPTS is exactly six pairs (four self-transition duplicates + two late-handshake pairs); every other illegal pair — including anything out of ERROR and any backwards jump to INIT — is PROTOCOL_VIOLATION and escalates to State.ERROR
- [Phase 02-03]: NET-05: transition() calls the injected reporter from a single call site before the outcome branch, guaranteeing every illegal attempt is reported exactly once and a legal transition reports zero times
- [Phase 02-03]: reporter is injected as a TransitionReporter Protocol parameter, not imported — state_machine.py has zero dependency on 02-04's event log, keeping 02-03/02-04 same-wave-safe; 02-04's adapter must match the exact keyword-only __call__(*, current, target, severity, reason) -> None shape
- [Phase 02-03]: NET-02: TurnStateMachine keeps state on the instance only (self._state); no module-level mutable current-state variable anywhere in state_machine.py
- [Phase 02-04]: D-11/NET-05/NET-07: append_event() enforces validate->serialize->write->flush->os.fsync->echo, in that literal order — a rejected record never creates/grows the log, durability always precedes the console echo
- [Phase 02-04]: D-14/D-18/NET-07 (RESEARCH Pitfall 6): Watchdog.check_once() runs on_freeze (suppressing exceptions) THEN the injected exit_action, verified by reading the incident file from inside the exit callable itself; threshold_seconds/poll_seconds are required keyword-only constructor args with no default in source
- [Phase 02-04]: watchdog_poll_seconds was already present in NetworkParams/network.json (=1, D-18) before this plan ran — no hand-off gap to close at 02-09
- [Phase 02-04]: Plan-internal tension (same category as 02-03's event_log substring issue): EventType.WATCHDOG_INCIDENT = "watchdog_incident" is required verbatim by the interfaces contract, but the plan's own verify/decoupling-audit scripts substring-scan for "watchdog" in event_log.py and flag it. Resolved by rewording every avoidable docstring mention (in both event_log.py and watchdog.py) and documenting the one irreducible, schema-required occurrence in the SUMMARY; true import-level decoupling (no `import` of watchdog in event_log.py or vice versa) independently re-verified and holds
- [Phase 02-05]: DOC-02: docs/PRD_mcp_transport.md written and approved in Wave 1, before any transport source exists (SEGAL §2.5 step 5) — documentation-only plan, zero source/config touched
- [Phase 02-05]: D-16/D-18 category separation enforced structurally: §10.1 (PARAMETERS.md-traced: 30s/60s/3/5s, Table 19 rows 6/7/4/3) and §10.2 (engineering defaults: ports 8001/8002, watchdog_poll_seconds=1) are two visually distinct tables so neither reader nor future phase can conflate them
- [Phase 02-05]: D-17 reuse of Table 19 Gatekeeper rows 3-4 for the NET-06 retry/backoff pair documented in prose as a deliberate, auditable reuse (both minimum status, may be raised never lowered) rather than an invented second pair of numbers
- [Phase 02-06]: NET-09 seam: register_tools/build_server/PeerRuntime all accept a keyword-only handshake_handler; None keeps the D-05 generic ack (pinned so 02-08's fake-peer tests stay valid), a supplied async handler's reply is returned verbatim and nothing is enqueued -- the exact hook 02-09 uses to bind 02-08's respond_to_handshake without editing tools.py
- [Phase 02-06]: QUAL-02: all four D-05 handlers share one _accept(queue, message_type, turn, sender, payload) helper that translates Envelope.from_dict's TypeError/KeyError/ValueError into fastmcp.exceptions.ToolError, decode-before-enqueue so nothing half-parsed ever reaches the queue
- [Phase 02-06]: RESEARCH Open Question 2 resolved by measurement, not assumption: task.cancel() alone left the listening port bound (FastMCP 3.4.5's run_http_async has no exposed uvicorn should_exit handle); PeerRuntime now binds its own listening socket and hands it to run_async via sockets=[...] so stop() closes the real OS socket directly -- re-measured SHUTDOWN CLEAN
- [Phase 02-06]: fastmcp 3.4.5 API shape notes for later plans -- no plural mcp.get_tools(); use (await mcp.get_tool(name)).fn for the coroutine-function guard; Client has no public timeout attribute, only the private _session_kwargs['read_timeout_seconds'], but client.transport.url is public
- [Phase 02-07]: Exception-surface correction for all later plans touching NET-06/transport errors: the installed fastmcp 3.4.5/mcp packages spell the transport exception `McpError` (mixed case), NOT `MCPError` as 02-RESEARCH.md's cited snippet spells it -- `from mcp import MCPError` raises ImportError; `from mcp import McpError` is correct. issubclass(ToolError, McpError) is False, so RESEARCH Pitfall 4's except-clause design (ToolError excluded from the retryable set) is unaffected, only the import spelling
- [Phase 02-07]: D-13/D-17 implemented: RETRYABLE_TRANSPORT_ERRORS = (McpError, DeadlineExpired); except ToolError: raise placed BEFORE except RETRYABLE_TRANSPORT_ERRORS inside call_with_retry so an application-level tool rejection can never become an unearned technical win; exhausted retries return a CallOutcome carrying a TechnicalWin (reason, attempts, timeout_seconds, backoff_seconds, elapsed_seconds, last_error) as a returned value only -- deadline.py never ends the game, scores, or logs
- [Phase 02-07]: __all__ written as an immutable tuple, not a list, in deadline.py -- satisfies both the plan's literal "export the seven public names" instruction and the NET-02 AST guard that forbids module-level list/dict/set literals
- [Phase 02-09]: Design note 8 resolved: call_with_retry DOES retry DeadlineExpired (RETRYABLE_TRANSPORT_ERRORS includes it), so await_opponent_turn wraps wait_for_opponent in call_with_retry rather than declaring a technical win on the first inbound timeout; retries_attempted is always the measured attempt count, never a constant
- [Phase 02-09]: Two 150-line-gate splits: orchestrator.py -> {orchestrator.py, turn_actions.py} (not pre-authorised by the plan, done anyway per Segal's hard line limit) and agent_lifecycle.py -> {agent_lifecycle.py, agent_wiring.py} (pre-authorised). The orchestrator/turn_actions re-export needed a PEP 562 module __getattr__ instead of an eager import -- an eager cross-import was reproduced as a genuine circular import when turn_actions.py was imported first, verified fixed under both import orders
- [Phase 02-09]: fastmcp.Client is a required async context manager (Client.__aenter__ calls self._connect()) -- take_my_turn/run_agent always enter it via `async with` before calling a tool; the plan's own pseudocode omitted this and was adapted accordingly
- [Phase 02-10]: Real production bug found and fixed via 02-10's GATE-3 test, not by 02-10 itself: turn_actions.py's take_my_turn unconditionally re-attempted State.MY_TURN every call, but await_opponent_turn's own final line legitimately leaves the machine at MY_TURN at the end of every cycle after the first -- colliding as an illegal self-transition, silently no-opping every second-and-later turn and starving await_opponent_turn into a FALSE technical win. No 02-09 unit test ever drove a real second cycle to catch it. Fixed by guarding take_my_turn's entry attempt on `current is not State.MY_TURN`, symmetric to await_opponent_turn's own guarded HANDSHAKE entry. A second, related bug (await_opponent_turn calling Envelope.from_dict on an already-decoded Envelope -- tools.py's real _accept enqueues an Envelope instance, never a dict) was fixed the same way. Both confirmed via standalone probe scripts and re-verified at real two-process scale (Task 4: a full 35-turn game completed cleanly to SURVIVAL)
- [Phase 02-10]: NET-05's RECOVERABLE severity coverage was never uniquely provided by the orchestrator-level test that assumed the now-fixed buggy behavior -- it was always independently covered by tests/unit/test_state_machine.py::test_recoverable_attempt_keeps_machine_usable (QUAL-02); the orchestrator-level test was corrected to assert the fixed behavior instead of the bug
- [Phase 02-10]: A three-way split was needed for the integration gate modules (test_peer_roundtrip.py, test_turn_isolation.py, test_turn_lifecycle.py, test_turn_resilience.py), one level deeper than the plan's own two-way split anticipation -- test_turn_lifecycle.py still exceeded 150 lines after the first split, so the two GATE-2 tests moved to test_turn_isolation.py, exactly the contingency the plan named in advance

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~Team code (SUB-06)~~ **Decided: `khm-mn17`** (08-CONTEXT.md); per-game config naming still a league prerequisite
- Reporting (REPORT-01) is submission-critical: a missing/contradictory report zeroes both teams
- League opponents must be contacted early (this week) — scored games realistically Aug 11–12 post-exam

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-07-29T17:15:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 02-10-PLAN.md (tests/integration/conftest.py, test_peer_roundtrip.py,
  test_turn_isolation.py, test_turn_lifecycle.py, test_turn_resilience.py — the §10.4
  phase-gate + NET-01..09 coverage-audit + real two-process-launch plan, the final Phase-2
  plan). SUMMARY at .planning/phases/02-fastmcp-infrastructure/02-10-SUMMARY.md, including
  the corrected NET-01..09 audit table and the "§10.4 criterion 2 — real process evidence"
  section from Task 4.
  Carried forward: Phase-01 code review CR-01 still deferred; Phase-2 triplet
  (docs/phases/phase-2/{PRD,PLAN,TODO}.md) — TODO row 2-10 and the phase-gate checklist
  ticked this session; row 2-99 (verify-work's full sweep + root docs/TODO.md) remains.
Resume file: None — Phase 2's code plans are ALL complete. Next step is
  /gsd:verify-work 2 (confirm the phase gate, tick 2-99 + root docs/TODO.md, confirm the
  .planning/graphs/ refresh happened this phase), then start Phase 3 with /gsd:graphify
  (mandatory before /gsd:plan-phase 3 for N>=3 per CLAUDE.md) followed by
  /gsd:discuss-phase 3 --batch.
  Per-day sequence from Phase 3 on: /gsd:graphify → [/gsd:ai-integration-phase N for 3 & 4]
  → /gsd:plan-phase N --chunked → /gsd:execute-phase N → /gsd:verify-work N
