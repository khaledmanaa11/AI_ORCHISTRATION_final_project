status: executing
Resume file: None -- 07-08 is fully committed and closed, tree clean. NEXT IS 07-09 (GATE-7
  measurement, docs/PRD_gatekeeper.md and OAUTH-RUNBOOK.md), then 07-10 (the one autonomous-false
  plan -- OAuth consent, one live send, screenshots, and the games-played VALUE decision, OQ-5).
  WHAT 07-08 LEAVES FOR THE PLANS THAT OWN IT, AND IT IS FIVE THINGS -- (1) 07-09 must take
  criterion-3 evidence through `open_replay(path).verdict`, which IS the value the banner renders;
  there is deliberately NO one-call `verdict_for(artifact)` wrapper, because the production-caller
  grep found it TEST-ONLY in this plan's own work and it was removed rather than excused;
  (2) ALL THREE verdict states must appear in the GATE-7 report, not only the OK one -- a run that
  can only ever show `Verified OK` proves nothing, so feed it the tampered artifact and the
  zero-turn one as well, exactly as tests/integration/test_replay_roundtrip.py does; (3) the replay
  app REFUSES any path not named `log_`, so `<uid>.jsonl`, `<uid>.ledger.jsonl`, `result_` and
  `declaration_` each get exit 2 and a message naming rule 18 -- the in-progress-game question is
  decided BY REFUSAL rather than by convention, and main() verifies before it builds a Tk root;
  (4) `--step-ms` is required with NO default anywhere in src/ (OQ-6 a second time), so 07-10 must
  state the value it screenshots with; (5) the three banner colours are pinned by test, so a
  screenshot showing green is showing OK. Eighteen deferred items still sit in the phase's
  deferred-items.md, unchanged by this plan except that D7-8's constraint is now satisfied by
  ABSENCE -- the artifact carries no belief_argmax at all, and a render-time scan asserts the
  viewer does not reintroduce one, with a control proving the scan can find a planted name. Still
  open and NOT fixed per the scope boundary -- check_no_llm_in_strategy.sh has been absent from
  quality-gate.yml since 03-10, and D7-5's recoverable handshake transition still fires once per
  run. OQ-1/OQ-2/OQ-3 are CLOSED in code with citations; OQ-4 is CLOSED by 07-07; OQ-6 is CLOSED
  structurally by 07-06 and re-applied here. OQ-5 -- the games-played VALUE -- remains the human's
  at 07-10, before any live send. NOTHING IN THIS REPO TRANSMITS -- the replay viewer opens one
  local file and draws it, both shipped reporting.json files still read mode dry_run, and
  git diff config/ is empty.
stopped_at: PHASE 7 PLAN 08 EXECUTED (2026-08-17) -- THE REPLAY VIEWER, AND THE MEASUREMENT THAT
  MAKES ITS BANNER WORTH ANYTHING. On the real dev_launch game 55fa28cbef618a19, with BOTH
  `<uid>.jsonl` AND `<uid>.ledger.jsonl` MOVED OFF DISK on both seats FIRST, both seats show
  `Verified OK` at 5/5 committed turns re-hashed -- read back off the RENDERED Tk widget rather
  than off the model that fed it. THREE VERDICT STATES, NOT TWO, AND THE THIRD IS THE WHOLE PLAN.
  security/audit_record.py says its verdict is 'vacuously True for an empty list', which is right
  for the AUDIT and a lie on a SCREEN, so the non-zero-committed-turn guard runs BEFORE any
  aggregate -- dropping it makes an empty artifact read `Verified OK` (probe 2, 4 failed), and a
  zero-turn file reads `Nothing to verify` instead. THE SECOND-SERIALIZER MEASUREMENT IS THE ONE
  THAT MATTERS -- the worst failure of this screen is not a missed forgery but a FALSE FAILED,
  which accuses an honest opponent of our own formatting, and replacing verify_reveal with a fresh
  json.dumps(sort_keys=True) re-hash reports FALSE FAILED on 5 of 5 committed turns on BOTH seats
  of the real game, 10 of 10 (probe 1, 15 failed). grep json.dumps over services/reporting/ returns
  five hits and every one is inside a docstring forbidding it. FOUR SINGLE-FIELD TAMPERS ARE FOUR
  TESTS, never one parametrize case, each RESEALED first so the verdict is earned by the per-turn
  re-hash and not by the artifact seal, each asserted to name the tampered turn and explicitly NOT
  turn 0; mutation shapes reused from scripts/gate6_tamper.py rather than invented. On the real
  game a barrier turn's move was flipped stay->south and the banner read
  'FAILED -- turn 4 re-hash does not match h_commit' at 4/5. A FIFTH TAMPER IS GENUINELY ADDITIVE
  -- outcome sits inside the seal and inside no commit hash, so every turn still re-hashes 4/4 and
  the artifact is still FAILED, which is why the seal check is not redundant. THE IN-PROGRESS-GAME
  QUESTION IS DECIDED BY REFUSAL, for two independent reasons -- the artifact does not exist during
  play (D-64/SEC-04, enforced by the reachability scan), and load_artifact rejects any path not
  named `log_`. gui/ stays logic-free (2 files, 181 code lines, zero BinOps, zero f-strings) and
  check_local_truth.py reports OK 7 modules scanned, exit 0, grown by exactly two -- the gate
  needed NO widening because 07-06 had already pre-authorised
  pursuit.services.reporting.replay_verify as the one service path a view may reach.
  test_gui_structural.py now READS that allowlist instead of keeping a second hardcoded copy, and
  the gate loader was extracted to tests/unit/local_truth_helpers.py rather than copied a third
  time. Seven revert probes, every count real, anchor asserted present and mutation asserted landed
  before each run. Two holes found in my own work -- banner_colour measured 98% because its only
  caller lives in the coverage-omitted gui/ (07-06's lit_cells finding again, tested rather than
  excused), and verdict_for had TEST-ONLY reachability and was REMOVED.

Last session: 2026-08-17T12:20:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 07-08-PLAN.md (the replay viewer -- load `log_`, recompute every hash,
  verdict banner, step/play/pause) in full. Three tasks, each committed atomically: Task 1 the
  verifier with its three verdicts and the non-zero-turn guard ahead of every aggregate
  (`bd1ce8d`); Task 2 the two thin Tk files that render and decide nothing (`cce667a`); Task 3 the
  round trip on a real game with both sources deleted, plus the production-caller scan (`f67e6b1`).
  A fourth commit closed two findings in my own work (`cbc6e97`): `banner_colour`'s one line, which
  was untested only because its sole caller lives in the coverage-omitted `gui/`, and two inline
  literal tables inside assert-bearing loops, now named and floored. Gates: `ruff check .` 0
  violations; 2130 passed / 0 failed against the 2090 baseline; coverage 97.37% (baseline 97.29%);
  `check_line_limit.sh` exit 0 with all fifteen new/touched files ALSO checked explicitly by path;
  `check_local_truth.py` -> `OK: 7 module(s) scanned`, exit 0 (was 5, grew by exactly two);
  `check_no_llm_in_strategy.py` OK; every new `.py` confirmed NOT ignored by git (D7-10's guard);
  `python -m pursuit.gui.replay_app --help` exit 0 and the `--once` scripted launch exit 0 against
  the REAL artifact, while a `.jsonl` path gives exit 2 with a message naming rule 18;
  `scripts/dev_launch.py` exit 0, game `55fa28cbef618a19`, both seats `"matched":true`, outcome
  capture, zero `technical_win`, zero `watchdog_incident`; `git diff config/` EMPTY. Rule-38
  counters, all four: the full suite moved police 1921->1921 and thief 1914->1914 (delta 0/0); one
  real game moved 1920->1921 and 1913->1914 (delta 1/1). All four new `services/` modules at 100%
  coverage -- `replay_verdict.py`, `replay_source.py`, `replay_session.py`, `replay_verify.py` --
  and `gui/` holds 181 of the 620 new `src/` code lines, every one of them widget construction.
  AST scan over all seven of this plan's test/fixture files: 0 parametrize sites (the four tampers
  are four tests, deliberately) and 3 assert-bearing loops, two of which carried inline tables and
  are now floored. Production-caller grep over every new public name: `open_replay` <-
  `gui/replay_app.main`, `banner_colour`/`SECTION_TITLES` <- `gui/replay_panels`, and the one name
  with test-only reachability (`verdict_for`) removed rather than excused; graphify agrees
  independently -- `open_replay` at `replay_verify.py:163`, degree 11, with an incoming
  `main() [calls]` edge. Graph refreshed: 10266 nodes / 18371 edges / 588 communities.
  `07-08-SUMMARY.md` written with every number from a command run in this session, self-check
  PASSED (17 paths verified present AND tracked AND not gitignored, 4 task commits verified
  reachable, and two file-size numbers CORRECTED rather than left as written).
  `docs/phases/phase-7/TODO.md` gains a ticked 07-08 row and a refreshed 07-96.
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean and 07-08 is closed. Next is `/gsd:execute-phase 7`
  continuing into 07-09 (GATE-7 measurement + `docs/PRD_gatekeeper.md` + `OAUTH-RUNBOOK.md`), which
  must take its criterion-3 evidence through `open_replay(path).verdict` and must report all THREE
  verdict states; then the human-in-the-loop 07-10.

Last session: 2026-08-17T23:55:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 07-07-PLAN.md (end-of-game reporting + `result_`) in full. Three tasks, each
  committed atomically: Task 1 the rule-35 agreement record, three-valued and never inferred
  (`e61b46c`); Task 2 `result_<game_id>.json` as one durable file per series with both token totals
  (`8377916`); Task 3 the game-end hook, contained, watchdog-touching, and wired at ONE call site
  beside `record_completed_game` (`4d68886`). Two further commits closed findings in my own work:
  the per-role artifact directory that a real game proved was a rule-35 disqualifier (`5aa9ec1`),
  and three assertions of mine that measured nothing (`7081515`). Gates: `ruff check .` 0
  violations; 2090 passed / 0 failed against the 2047 baseline; coverage 97.29% (baseline 97.19%);
  `check_line_limit.sh` exit 0 with all nineteen new `.py` files ALSO checked explicitly by path;
  `check_no_llm_in_strategy.py` OK; `check_local_truth.py` -> `OK: 5 module(s) scanned`, exit 0;
  every new `.py` and both new PRDs confirmed NOT ignored by git (D7-10's guard);
  `git diff config/{police,thief}/reporting.json` EMPTY and both still `dry_run`;
  `scripts/dev_launch.py` exit 0, game `a5dd2a98827f4df5`, both seats `matched=true` at turn 5,
  ZERO `technical_win` and ZERO `watchdog_incident`, and both seats wrote their OWN `log_` and
  `result_` under `game_artifacts/<role>/`. Rule-38 counters, all four: the full suite moved police
  1920->1920 and thief 1913->1913 (delta 0/0); one real game moved 1919->1920 and 1912->1913
  (delta 1/1). All six new source modules at 100% coverage -- `result_agreement.py`,
  `result_agreement_fields.py`, `artifact_result.py`, `result_artifact_fields.py`,
  `end_of_game.py`, `end_of_game_chain.py` -- and so is every other module in
  `services/reporting/`. `agent_entrypoint.py` measured 103 -> 107 of its 150 permitted code lines.
  AST scan over all thirteen of this plan's test/fixture files: 0 parametrize sites, 4
  assert-bearing loops, every one floored. Production-caller grep over all 25 new public names:
  every one referenced in `src/` outside its defining module, and `report_game_end` reaches
  `network/agent_entrypoint.py` -- D7-14 closed, and `test_log_artifact_reachability.py` now NAMES
  the `log_` builder's five reachers so its empty-list assertion cannot be green because the
  builder is dead code. Two per-mechanism PRDs written per CLAUDE.md Sec2.3:
  `docs/PRD_result_artifact.md` and `docs/PRD_end_of_game.md`. Graphify refreshed -- 10027 nodes /
  17957 edges / 575 communities; `graphify explain report_game_end` resolves to
  `end_of_game.py:89` (degree 16, `--> _report()`) and `record_sub_game` to
  `artifact_result.py:147` (degree 9). `07-07-SUMMARY.md` written with every number from a run in
  this session, self-check PASSED (26 paths verified present AND tracked, 5 task commits verified
  reachable, and five file-size numbers CORRECTED rather than left as written).
  `docs/phases/phase-7/TODO.md` gains a ticked 07-07 row and a refreshed 07-96; D7-14 closed, and
  D7-17 (`game_id` is minted per GAME while PARAMETERS reads it as the SERIES id) and D7-18 (a
  QuotaManager path is unguarded against the shipped `config/` tree) filed in the phase's
  `deferred-items.md`.
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean and 07-07 is closed. Next is `/gsd:execute-phase 7`
  continuing into 07-08 (the replay viewer), which must floor `verify_log_turns` on
  `committed > 0`, inherits D7-8 and the 07-06 quantisation rule, and now also reads `result_`
  from `game_artifacts/<role>/`; then 07-09 and the human-in-the-loop 07-10.

Last session: 2026-08-17T22:40:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 07-06-PLAN.md (the live GUI -- a separate process over a published
  LocalView snapshot) in full. Three tasks, each committed atomically: Task 1 the best-effort
  publisher plus its read half, the one call site in `maybe_resolve`, and the leak scan run over
  the WRITTEN FILE with its five-variant counter-control (`56e4d96`); Task 2 the five thin `gui/`
  files over `sdk/view_render.py` + `sdk/view_text.py`, and the runtime recovery test that found
  the quantisation channel (`840636b`); Task 3 the local-truth gate turned green BY CODE with
  D7-9's three blind spots measured open then closed, split at 198 lines into
  `scripts/local_truth_ast.py` (`ad46940`). A fourth commit closed four findings in my own work
  (`dea2a60`): `lit_cells`'s test-only reachability wired into `view_text._support`, one unguarded
  assert-bearing loop rewritten as a set comparison, both inline parametrize tables named and
  floored, and the last uncovered branch (a scent-free view) covered. Gates: `ruff check .` 0
  violations; 2047 passed / 0 failed against the 1974 baseline; coverage 97.19% (baseline 97.12%);
  `check_line_limit.sh` exit 0 with all twenty-one new/touched files ALSO checked explicitly by
  path; `check_local_truth.py` -> `OK: 5 module(s) scanned`, exit 0, and the `.sh` wrapper the same;
  `check_no_llm_in_strategy.py` OK; every new `.py` confirmed NOT ignored by git (D7-10's guard);
  grep of `gui/` for the four forbidden spellings -> no hits, prose included;
  `python -m pursuit.gui.live_app --help` exit 0 with `--refresh-ms` shown as required and exit 2
  when it is omitted; `--once` scripted launch exit 0 against a synthetic snapshot AND against both
  seats of the real game; `scripts/dev_launch.py` exit 0, game `2db6cc8b039c82e7`, both seats
  matched=true, outcome capture, zero `technical_win`, zero `watchdog_incident`. Rule-38
  counters, all four: the full suite moved police 1918->1918 and thief 1911->1911 (delta 0/0); one
  real game moved 1917->1918 and 1910->1911 (delta 1/1). All four new sdk modules at 100% coverage:
  view_publish.py, view_snapshot.py, view_render.py, view_text.py; `gui/` is coverage-omitted and
  holds 200 of the 579 new `src/` code lines (34.5%), every one of them widget construction, which
  `test_gui_structural.py` enforces structurally. AST parametrize/loop scan over all six of this
  plan's test files: 2 parametrize sites, both now NAMED and floored; 4 assert-bearing loops, three
  already guarded and one found UNGUARDED and rewritten. Graphify refreshed -- 9734 nodes / 17412
  edges / 579 communities; `graphify explain publish_view` resolves to `view_publish.py:90`
  (degree 17, edge in from `maybe_resolve`) and `LiveDashboard` to `live_app.py:47`.
  `07-06-SUMMARY.md` written with every number from a run in this session, self-check PASSED (25
  paths and 4 task commits verified, every new source/test file additionally verified TRACKED by
  git, and the `gui/` line share recomputed independently at 200/579 = 34.5%).
  `docs/phases/phase-7/TODO.md` gains a ticked 07-06 row and a refreshed 07-96; D7-6, D7-7 and D7-9
  marked RESOLVED and D7-15/D7-16 filed in the phase's `deferred-items.md`.
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean and 07-06 is closed. Wave 2 of phase 7 is COMPLETE. Next is
  `/gsd:execute-phase 7` continuing into 07-07 (end-of-game reporting + `result_`), which owns
  D7-13/D7-14 and the D7-3/D7-12 wiring; then 07-08, 07-09 and the human-in-the-loop 07-10.

Last session: 2026-08-17T16:10:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 07-05-PLAN.md (the log_ artifact -- wire JSONL x nonce ledger, joined on
  local turn truth) in full. Three tasks, each committed atomically: Task 1 the join, the
  crash-tolerant reader and the adversarial disjoint-turn fixture (`3f503b2`), Task 2 the
  artifact, its seal and the deleted-sources integration proof (`e6ea7f0`), Task 3 the nonce
  boundary pinned as a SCAN rather than recorded as a grep, plus `docs/PRD_log_artifact.md`
  (`1d0a47d`). Three further commits closed findings in my own work: the four defensive branches
  coverage exposed and the last unguarded assert-bearing loop (`fdb95eb`), the D-61 two-game_uid
  fix (`4787e11`), and trimming log_join.py off the exact 150/150 limit (`34169fd`). Gates:
  `ruff check .` 0 violations; 1974 passed / 0 failed against the 1919 baseline; coverage 97.12%
  (baseline 97.02%); `check_line_limit.sh` exit 0 with all twelve new files ALSO checked
  explicitly by path (the no-arg form enumerates via git ls-files and passes VACUOUSLY on an
  untracked file); `check_no_llm_in_strategy.py` OK; every new `.py` confirmed NOT ignored by git
  (D7-10's guard); `scripts/dev_launch.py` exit 0, game `521519a78f96c255`, both seats
  `"matched":true`, outcome capture at turn 5. Rule-38 counters, all four: the full suite moved
  police 1916->1916 and thief 1909->1909 (delta 0/0); one real game moved 1916->1917 and
  1909->1910 (delta 1/1). All five new modules at 100% coverage: log_join.py, log_read.py,
  log_turn_fields.py, log_artifact_fields.py, artifact_log.py. AST parametrize scan over all
  seven of this plan's test/fixture files: 3 sites, two named sources both length-guarded and one
  inline 5-element literal with a positive control; 2 assert-bearing loops, one already guarded
  and one -- over LOG_ARTIFACT_MODULES -- found UNGUARDED and now floored at 4. Graphify refreshed
  -- 9449 nodes / 16882 edges; `graphify explain write_log_artifact` resolves to
  `artifact_log.py:129` (degree 14) and `join_game` to `log_join.py:119` (degree 25); graph.html
  skipped by the tool at 9449 nodes against its 5000 viz limit, and it is a gitignored local-only
  artifact anyway. `07-05-SUMMARY.md` written with every number from a run in this session,
  self-check PASSED (19 paths and 5 task commits verified, and every new source/test file
  additionally verified TRACKED by git). `docs/phases/phase-7/TODO.md` gains a ticked 07-05 row
  with its measured evidence; D7-13 and D7-14 filed in the phase's `deferred-items.md`.
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean and 07-05 is closed. Wave 2 of phase 7 continues
  (`/gsd:execute-phase 7`): 07-06 (live GUI) is the last wave-2 plan. 07-07 is now fully
  unblocked and owns D7-13/D7-14; 07-08 consumes `verify_log_turns` and must floor it on
  `committed > 0`.

Stopped at: Completed 07-04-PLAN.md (the mail transport -- attached JSON, send-only scope, 429
  handled by the ONE gatekeeper) in full. Three tasks, each committed atomically: Task 1 the
  MIME shape asserted by re-parsing the rendered bytes (`86d9547` -- 17 tests, with the body
  and header leak checks each paired with a control that plants the distinctive value and
  requires the check to FAIL), Task 2 the MailSink protocol and DryRunSink plus the
  durable_write_bytes / write_artifact_bytes extractions (`c196535` -- 9 tests that claim only
  what a disk write can claim), Task 3 GmailSink against an injected fake transport
  (`6b686cd` -- 47 tests across three files, none satisfiable by DryRunSink). Gates:
  `ruff check .` 0 violations; 1919 passed / 0 failed against the 1846 baseline; coverage

  zero technical_win. Rule-38 counters, all four: the full suite moved police 1915->1915 and
  thief 1908->1908 (delta 0/0); one real game moved 1915->1916 and 1908->1909 (delta 1/1).
  Every new or touched module at 100% coverage: message.py, sink.py, gmail_sink.py,
  artifacts.py, durable_write.py. Collected test counts re-read from pytest rather than
  counted by hand -- 17 / 9 / 12 / 15 / 20 = 73, exactly the suite delta. Every parametrize
  site in this plan's five test files is length-guarded (4 sites, 4 guards), because an
  emptied table SKIPS silently. Graphify refreshed -- 9250 nodes / 16532 edges,
  `graphify explain GmailSink` resolves to `gmail_sink.py:153`. `07-04-SUMMARY.md` written
  with every number from a run in this session, self-check PASSED (18 paths and 3 commits
  verified, and the nine new source/test files additionally verified TRACKED by git -- the
  check that would have caught D7-10 on its own). `docs/phases/phase-7/TODO.md` gains a ticked
  07-04 row and moves 07-96 to in-progress; D7-10 (RESOLVED), D7-11 and D7-12 filed in the
  phase's `deferred-items.md`.
Resume file: None -- the tree is clean and 07-04 is closed. Wave 2 of phase 7 continues
  (`/gsd:execute-phase 7`): 07-05 (log_ builder) and 07-06 (live GUI). 07-07 consumes this
  plan's ReportingChain + sink wiring and owns D7-12.

Stopped at: Completed 07-11-PLAN.md (the display belief -- rules 8-9 recovery, not absence)
  in full. Three tasks, each committed atomically: Task 1 the RED reproduction on fixtures
  rebuilt to model production (`4c4c03d` -- 9 failed / 45 passed, including 07-03's OWN
  load-bearing absence test failing at `$.belief.argmax: pair [5, 3]`, with both anti-vacuity
  controls passing so the attack was proven to fire before being used as evidence), Task 2 the
  root-cause fix at the strategy layer with option (a) reasoned in source and in the new
  `docs/PRD_display_belief.md` (`19aa946`), Task 3 the three false docstrings corrected and the
  byte-level thief control added (`df041a0`). Gates: `ruff check .` 0 violations; 1846 passed /

Last session: 2026-08-17T05:40:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 07-03-PLAN.md (the rules 8-9 local-truth firewall) in full. Three
  tasks, each committed atomically: Task 1 the RED tests taken BEFORE the fix (`70df24a`
  -- two collection ERRORs naming the missing modules and 8 failures naming the missing
  script, quoted verbatim in the commit message), Task 2 `LocalView` + `view_builder`
  outside `gui/` (`f7d21c6`), Task 3 the CI gate wired and loud on an empty scan
  (`1ccd4ea`). Two further commits closed self-audit findings in my own work: the
  unpinned entropy value plus the 150-line test split (`094eb12`), and the two unguarded
  literal sets plus an unreachable `None` annotation (`7c69f81`). `07-03-SUMMARY.md`
  written with the three pre-fix failures verbatim, the production-caller grep, the
  thirty probe counts and the noted absence of `check_no_llm_in_strategy.sh` from CI.
  `docs/phases/phase-7/TODO.md` row 07-03 ticked with its measured evidence; D7-6 and
  D7-7 filed in the phase's `deferred-items.md`.
Resume file: None -- wave 1 of phase 7 is complete and the tree is clean. Next is
  `/gsd:execute-phase 7` continuing into wave 2 (07-04, 07-05, 07-06).

Stopped at: Completed 03-11-PLAN.md (graph primitives, run-2 wave 1's first plan) in
  full. All 3 tasks executed TDD (tests written and confirmed red before each
  implementation went green), each committed atomically: Task 1 `components.py`
  (`12be2e4`), Task 2 `cycles.py` (`52c85f2`), Task 3 `territory.py` (`b4b06fa`). A
  4th commit (`af5f0de`) closed a Rule-2 coverage gap found during final verification
  (two documented contract branches -- the DFS-root cut-vertex case and
  `cycle_rank(frozenset())==0` -- had no direct test; 2 tests added, package coverage
  98%->100%). `03-11-SUMMARY.md` written. Full repo gates green: `ruff check .` 0
  violations, line-limit clean (new files 100/37/55/32 code lines), 456 passed / 2
  skipped (the pre-existing GATE-4 skip, untouched), coverage 97.05% (>=85% floor).
  Graphify rebuilt and `GRAPH_REPORT.md` refreshed (3457 nodes/6273 edges/234
  communities). `docs/phases/phase-3/TODO.md` deliberately not touched -- its
  03-11..03-16 row numbering predates the 15-plan wave breakdown and reconciling it is
  03-24's ("triplet refresh") explicit job.
Resume file: None -- 07-00 is fully committed and closed. **Next step is the phase-7 plan
  set**: `07-PLAN-OUTLINE.md` defines 10 plans across 5 waves (07-01..07-10), of which only
  07-10 is `autonomous: false` (OAuth consent, one live send, presentation screenshots, and
  the games-played value decision). Plans 07-01..07-09 are not written yet. Wave 1 is a
  genuine three-way fan-out (07-01/07-02/07-03, no shared files) and would need WORKTREES to
  run in parallel -- the shared git index otherwise mixes commits. Four open questions from
  the outline still need deciding from the book/PARAMETERS rather than invented: OQ-1 daily
  send ceiling, OQ-2 DOS trip threshold, OQ-3 backoff 'stricter value' ambiguity, OQ-4
  result_ per-series vs per-game. OQ-5 was this plan.

Last session: 2026-08-04T13:00:00+03:00
Stopped at: Completed 03-12-PLAN.md (thief safety rule -- never step into N[cop], run-2
  wave 1's second plan) in full. Both tasks committed atomically: Task 1 `safety.py`
  (`71b201d`, test-first: `test_safety.py` confirmed red against a `ModuleNotFoundError`
  before the module existed, green after -- 7 unit tests), Task 2 wiring + regression
  guard (`20d87f6`). `src/pursuit/strategy/safety.py` -- `closed_neighbourhood`/
  `safe_moves`, pure (D-03), never-empty guarantee, docstring carries the full D-31
  296/300=0.987 vs 283/300=0.943 provenance plus the unsoftened "did not fully
  reproduce, lost 3/20, flawed control" caveat. `fallback.py::_evade` filters legal
  moves through `safe_moves` before ranking with the UNCHANGED
  `(unreachable?, distance, onward)` key -- filter-then-rank, `_pursue` byte-identical.
  `tests/unit/strategy/test_fallback.py` needed zero changes (verified before/after,
  all 6 cases hold under the filtered behaviour). New
  `tests/integration/test_thief_safety.py`: non-vacuous 160-game regression guard, two
  arms differing ONLY by `monkeypatch.context()`-scoped patches of `fallback.safe_moves`
  (real spy vs no-op) against the same 20 committed GATE-4 scenarios + 60 seeded random
  starts (`n=60`, `REGRESSION_TOLERANCE=0.05`, `seed=314159`, named test-local
  constants, D-19); asserts grid filtered-survival >= unfiltered, random-start rate
  within one noise band, filter-bound counter > 0 (non-vacuous), and the per-turn
  N[cop] invariant across all 160 games via a spy wrapper. Does not reproduce D-31's
  own flawed disabled-barrier control. `03-12-SUMMARY.md` written (self-check PASSED).
  One deviation, a documentation correction (not a code fix): the plan's own
  ~100ms/game timing estimate did not reproduce -- measured ~34-38s for the 160-game
  suite, `cProfile`-traced to 03-07's pre-existing `choose_barrier` (out of this plan's
  scope), not this plan's own code. Recorded honestly in the test module's own
  docstring; `n=60` was NOT reduced and barrier placement was NOT disabled to chase the
  stale target. Full repo gates green: `ruff check .` 0 violations, line-limit clean
  (new files 50/76/157 code lines, `fallback.py` still well inside its own ceiling),
  464 passed / 2 skipped (same 2 pre-existing skips as 03-11), coverage 97.95%
  (>=85% floor), `safety.py`/`fallback.py` both individually 100% covered. Full-repo
  `--cov` run took 7m47s on this Windows machine, confirmed genuinely CPU-bound
  throughout (`Get-Process ... CPU`), not the known Windows stdio-hang pattern.
  Graphify rebuilt (3523 nodes/6406 edges/233 communities) and `GRAPH_REPORT.md`
  refreshed and committed. `docs/phases/phase-3/TODO.md` deliberately not touched --
  same rationale as 03-11 (03-24's "triplet refresh" job).
Resume file: None -- 07-00 is fully committed and closed. **Next step is the phase-7 plan
  set**: `07-PLAN-OUTLINE.md` defines 10 plans across 5 waves (07-01..07-10), of which only
